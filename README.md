# jumpy
Super simple 2D jumping game inspired by doodle jump using the godot engine.

## Structure
This project consists of two scenes, one for the title with a label and a few buttons, and one for the main game. The `start` button takes you to the game scene, the `leaderboard` button doesn't do anything, and the `quit` button closes the game.

When you die in the game, your score will be shown on a game-over splash screen and you'll be given two buttons, the first will take you to a new game, and the second will take you back to the main menu.

Please feel free to look through the code and use it however you want. This project was created in less than 24hrs as part of a mini-jam so it's deliberately incomplete! Tweet [@not_reuty](https://twitter.com/not_reuty) for questions!
